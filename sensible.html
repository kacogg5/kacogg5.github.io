                The Sensible Project
            </h1>
            <h4>
                Made for the CBU College of Engineering
            </h4>
            <p>
                Students in EGR 102 participate in an all-out competition, pitting their self-designed bots against the other teams'. While they are designing their vehicles, Devitia works behind the scenes to make it all possible. The competition involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A web application displaying live data</li>
                <li>Remote-controlled bots with various sensors</li>
                <li>Amazon Web Services' suite of tools and services</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
            <h2>
                The Sensible App
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sensible provides a live stream of data during the competition. Teams competing view their bot's data via the Sensible app, which determines how they play the round. Moderators and professors can access all bots at once and keep an eye on everything. The Devitia team built this interactive site from scratch.
            </p>
        <h2>
            The Bots
        </h2>
        <p>
            At the core of each bot, an ESP32 handles reading, processing, and transmitting data to the cloud, working on a lite distribution of Python, called Micropython. The ESP32 collects data from at least 6 sensors at a time and sends the data off.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Amazon Web Services
        </h2>
        <p>
            This project would be pointless if not for the technology that was developed by Amazon for us to use. Amazon Web Services enabled our team to build a quality product with relative ease. What might have taken several months or even years to develop ourselves took just a few weeks, and even that was learning how to use the AWS platform.

            My Involvement
        </h2>
        <p>
            Over the Course of this project, I've contributed in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing in an active codebase.</li>
            <li>Designing and implementing major features of the Sensible App.</li>
            <li>Managing a network of IoT devices through AWS.</li>
            <li>Understanding and working with microcontrollers like the ESP 32.</li>
            <li>Showing initiative by taking on tasks that weren't assigned to me.</li>
        </ul>
